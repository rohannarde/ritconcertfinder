I have implemented an iOS application which finds concerts based on artist name or city name.

The back end of the app is an RESTful web service called JamBase which supplies real time data about concerts in
the form of XML files. This data is being parsed and displayed to the user in tabs. 

Some features of this app are:

1. Displays list of concerts and detailed information about each. We can add a concert as favorite to track it. 
2. Map directions to concerts using Google Geolocation API.
3. iPod synchronization for automatically adding favorite artists.
